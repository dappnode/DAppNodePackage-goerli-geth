<!--Brief introduction about the source project (official project definition is an option): -->

GÃ¶rli Testnet is the first proof-of-authority cross-client testnet, syncing with Parity Ethereum, Geth, Nethermind, Hyperledger Besu (formerly Pantheon), and EthereumJS clients. This testnet is a community-based project, completely open-source, naturally. It was born in September 2018 during ETHBerlin and has been growing in contributors ever since.

More information about the source project can be found at [their official website](https://goerli.net/)
